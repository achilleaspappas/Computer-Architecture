# Computer Architecture
The purpose of this project is to write basic assembly programs using MIPS-Assembly. This project was part of a course I did in my 3st semester.

## Prerequisites
To use the files in this repository, you will need the following:
1. [Mars](https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) in order to run the MIPS-Assembly files.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MARS.
3. Assemble the file (click on the "Tools" menu and select "Assemble").
4. Run the code (click on the "Tools" menu and select "Run").
